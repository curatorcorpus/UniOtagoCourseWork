I'm not great a modeling living creatures, nor do I consider myself an animator.  I'm a filmmaker who does his own VFX, so simple is best.  I made a low poly bird, rigged it, animated it, and copied it three times.  There is a bird control empty to move them around the scene.  To use, simply load a pre-made scene, or live action plate into Blender, frame up the shot, and position the birds somewhere in the background.  Keyframe that and hit render!  You can make the birds any color you want, right now they're black as I needed crows for my current project.  Hope this helps some other VFX artists!</blockquote><hr /><h3>Help us moderate this file</h3><p>Blend Swap is a place to share and get awesome 3D work, if you think this blend falls into one of the following issues please file a report from <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/83842">http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/83842</a> by clicking on the <strong>Manage</strong> panel to the left of the blend and then on <strong>Report/Flag</strong>:</p><ul><li>The blend author didn't make this blend and posted it as their own.</li><li>The blend author is violating a Creative Commons License or copyright.</li><li>The blend is incomplete, work in progress, or has missing textures.</li><li>The blend contains simulation cache files and other unneeded media.</li><li>The preview image has nothing to do with the blend's contents.</li></ul><p>Your help allows the site to stay clear of broken and stolen work.</p><hr /><h4>Notes:</h4><ul><li>Do NOT report this blend if you dont' know how to use a feature on Blender, instead use the <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/questions">questions section</a> of the site.</li></ul></article><footer>Original file hosted by <a href="http://www.blendswap.com">Blend Swap, LLC</a>.</footer></body></html>
