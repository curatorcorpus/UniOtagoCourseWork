PROBLEM LOG

Day 1 (09/03/2017): 
- The most problem we faced was trying to learn and understand the new Robotc API.
- Different opinions on using the API in the group.
- Quickly overcome with time, effort and basing our code on the example code.
- Line correction, non-powered motor, black square alerts (intervals too long).
- Trying to get correct color sensors working correctly.
- nSyncedMotor doesn't work.
